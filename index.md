# Our History
## From Dark Origins
We started with a basic, buggy game. Each sprite was only 4 by 4 pixels, and the hero was a void which wandered in a dark, low-resolution land.
  
We decided the game's ability to randomly generate floors had a lot of potential, and so we started to create a game worth playing with this base.

## New and Improved: Mousy Game v1.0
Our first version of the game had new and improved graphics, and a working potion item.
  
There were many bugs, however. We didn't want our courageous hero to spawn into walls, so we went back to our code to fix everything.

## Adding Utility: Of Mice and Cats v2.0
This is the version of the game we currently have. We have a start menu, death screen, and HP bar.
We've added sound, an introduction section, and a screen to show when you win!

## What we would do in the future
Our code makes it difficult to add animations, but if we had the time to completely redo our code structure we would make sure that animations were integrated from the beginning. We also would create a boss and puzzle floor, and make another type of enemy.
